👋 Tosin Amuda

Enterprise Architect at IBM doing mostly Applied AI Engineering. I bridge research ideas and papers to production systems—replicating academic work, fine-tuning models, and building agents that ship at scale.

**What I build here:**
- Research replications: UIST 2024 Memolet (conversational memory)
- Fine-tuning pipelines: Llama 3.2 3B with LoRA + DSPy as Synthetic Data Generator Layer (ranked 47/198 in AWS AI League)
- Agent systems: LangGraph, AWS Strand 
- Full-stack AI apps: React/TypeScript frontends, FastAPI/Express backends, vector search

Open to Applied AI Engineering roles.
